                <h2>Application Information</h2>
                <h4>General</h4>
                <p>
                    The Surface Water Quality application provides testing results for water
                    monitored by state, federal, tribal and local agencies. The data is collected from the
                    <a href="https://www.waterqualitydata.us/">Water Quality Portal (WQP)</a> which is a
                    service sponsored by the United States Geological Survey (USGS), the Environmental
                    Protection Services (EPA), and the National Water Quality Monitoring Council (NWQMC).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Warning: This application is designed only to present existing data provided
                    through the WQP and is not intended to by a primary source for evaluating if a
                    body of water is safe to use for fishing, swimming or other recreational
                    purposes. It is also important to note that water quality can vary significantly
                    over time and in response to various events (e.g. storms, drought, temperature,
                    etc.).
                </p>
                <h4>Technical</h4>
                <p>
                    This application gathers data from the WQP, over the last 16 months, and compares
                    the results against the National Recommended Water Quality Criteria, which are
                    developed by the EPA under Section 304(a) of the Clean Water Act. These
                    recommended criteria represent specific levels of chemicals or conditions in
                    a water body that are expected to not cause adverse effects to human health.
                    EPA provides recommendations for consumption of “water + organism” and “organism
                    only” human health criteria; however, with this application, we only consider
                    the less stringent "organism only" criteria to provide a reference for
                    individuals who wish to use a body of water for recreational purposes (e.g.
                    fishing and swimming). You can find a table of these recommended criteria
                    <a href="https://www.epa.gov/wqc/national-recommended-water-quality-criteria-human-health-criteria-table">here</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All criteria should be considered when evaluating a body of water for fishing;
                    however, only pathogens (e.g. Escherichia coli, Enterococci and historically fecal
                    coliforms) and cyanotoxins (draft recommendations) are currently used by the EPA to evaluate
                    whether a body of water is safe for swimming. You can find more details about
                    the pathogen thresholds and our conservative assumptions to simplify the results in
                    the limit info section when a result is selected.
                </p>
                <h2>Using the Application</h2>
                <h4>Find a Monitoring Station</h4>
                <p>
                    When the application launches you will see a map. Slide the map around to find
                    monitoring locations. A message will display with instructions to zoom in or out
                    if there are no stations or too many stations to display. If needed, click on a
                    marker cluster icon to zoom into individual stations. Stations are only
                    displayed if results are available within the last 16 months and are
                    color coded by warning level. Each result is assigned a warning level based on
                    the criteria recommended limits, if available, and each station is assigned a
                    warning level based on the most recent results for each chemical or condition.
                    Result warning level are assigned as follows:

                <p>
                    To view location details and results for a particular monitoring station, click
                    on the station marker. Station details are displayed followed by a list of
                    the most recent results for each chemical or condition. Results are ordered
                    first by highest warning level, if one exists, and then by date.

                <p>
                    To view the recommended limits and any historical results for a chemical or
                    condition, click on the desired result. This will display a screen with the
                    limit information followed by a graph with all the historical results, including
                    the most recent result, available over the past 16 months. If a limit is
                    available for the chemical or condition, a red line is drawn on the graph to
                    indicate the limit level. Any result measurements reported as not detected,
                    present below quantification limit, or trace are included in the historical
                    graph as zero.
